# Hi, I'm Yuliia! 👋
🌍 From Ukraine

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a passionate junior Front-end developer with a background in law and e-commerce. After several years of running my own online business and creating content for social media, I transitioned into tech and have been growing ever since.

💻 I specialize in building responsive and user-friendly web interfaces using:

[HTML5, CSS3, SASS, JavaScript, React, React Router, Redux, Redux Toolkit, REST API, Express, MongoDB]

🧠 I love learning, solving real-world problems with code, and bringing ideas to life through clean and efficient UI/UX.

🎯 Open to freelance projects, collaboration, or internship opportunities — especially remote or flexible roles.

📫 Let’s connect!
Feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together or just want to say hi!
